# Semester Project Instructions

Welcome to the Semester Project repository. This is where you will store and submit all of the components for your project. There are three main parts of your project: (1) proposal, (2) presentation, and (3) report. You can find a description of each component in the sections below. Be sure to read through these sections to learn about the structure, requirements, and due dates for each.

## Project Proposal

Before you can start your project, you first need to figure out what you're going to do. This will require you to explore various areas of computer vision and image processing for problems that strike your fancy. Try to remember that your idea does not have to be complicated. You'd be surprised how deep you can dive into a seemingly simple topic.

Once you've found an idea, you'll want to start doing some background research. During your research, ask yourself some probing questions. Has the idea been tried before? If so, what methods were used? How can I put my own spin on the project? What infrastructure do I need to complete the project? Answering these questions will also help you define the aims of your project. The aims section will be the centerpiece of your project proposal, and it will guide much of your writing. Speaking of sections, your proposal will have six of them: (1) title, (2) summary, (3) introduction, (4) aims, (5) research strategy, and (6) references. You will find guidance and requirements for each of these sections below.

### Proposal Details

The details below describe how you should write your proposal and the requirements for each section. You'll find that the proposal follows the structure of a typical research grant application. As such, each section has a character, word, or page limit. Following these limits will keep your proposal focused on the most important information.

- **Project Title:** The title of your project should convey what you plan to accomplish (and potentially how you plan to do so). Titles should be geared towards a general audience. (maximum of 81 character, including spaces)
- **Project Summary:** Briefly describe the central idea(s) of your project. (maximum of 250 words)
- **Introduction:** Discuss the necessary background required for a reader to understand your project aims. Be sure to motivate the problem(s) you plan to address, explain key concepts, and highlight any related works. (maximum of 1 page or 450 words)
- **Aims:** List two to four specific aims that capture the essence of what you plan to accomplish. Each aim should be numbered and discussed in its own paragraph. The first sentence of each aim should be a concise description of that goal (I suggest using bold font for this sentence to help it stand out). The following sentences should briefly summarize how you plan to address that aim. (maximum 1 page or 450 words)
- **Research Strategy:** Describe in detail how you plan to complete each aim from the previous section. Your Research Strategy should be divided into subsections, one for each aim. Summarize the general workflow that will be taken to address each aim and the timeline for completion. Identify who is responsible for each component of the aim. (maximum 2.5 pages or 1000 words)
- **References:** List any cited works from the above sections. (no limits)

The proposal must be committed to this repository either as a PDF or markdown file.

**Deadline: Friday, April 1 @ 5:00pm**

## Check-in

To help you keep on pace, you have the opportunity to submit a Check-In Report by week 10 of the course. The report is optional, but it can earn you up to 10 points towards your Project Proposal grade. The Check-In Report must contain two sections: (1) a summary of all work completed to-date and (2) an outline for how you plan to complete the remaining portions of your project.

- **Summary:** Describe what work has been completed to-date. Be sure to reference the appropriate files in your project repository and indicate which team members worked on each. It should be clear from your summary that a reasonable attempt has been made towards solving one or more of your project aims. (maximum 450 words)
- **Plan:** Describe how you plan to proceed with your project. Indicate which steps you plan to take towards each of your project aims. Highlight any issues that you are facing and suggest possible solutions for each (it's ok if you don't have a solution, but you should indicate this point and meet with me to develop a workaround). (maximum 450 words)

The check-in report must be committed to this repository as a markdown file.

**Deadline: Friday, April 29 @ 11:59pm**

## Project Presentation

Project presentations begin **Wednesday, May 18** and mark the end of the practical portion of your semester project. This is your chance to share your experience with your peers -- the successes as well as the failures. What is important here is not whether you accomplished all of your project aims but what you learned from attempting them and how well you can communicate your experience.

For you to present on your project, you need to be finished. All of your practical work should be completed by your presentation date. Your code and documentation must be submitted in its final form by the end of classes; however, I recommend that you submit these portions early so that you have time to prepare your presentation. Additional specifications regarding your code are given in the Code Details section below.

### Presentation Details

Each person or group will give a 15-minute presentation describing their work. Each presentation should include the following components.

- **Background:** Briefly introduce your project and summarize any information (e.g., concepts, software, notation) that the audience will need to understand later discussions. (2-5 mins)
- **Aims:** Outline the specific aims as described in your proposal. Be sure to use figures and diagrams as needed to help illustrate your points. (1-2 mins)
- **Strategy and Results:** For each aim, explain the strategy that was used to accomplish the aim and the results that were observed. Remember to include negative results -- these are often just as valuable as positive results. Again, figures and tables should be used to summarize and communicate your observations. (5-10 mins)
- **Conclusions:** Summarize the different findings from your project and identify steps that you might take to continue or improve the work in the future. (1-2 mins)

A PDF copy of the presentation must be committed to this repository.

**Deadline: 9:00am on your scheduled presentation day**

### Code Details

The coding requirements for each project will vary based on your specific aims. You are free to organize your source code as you see fit. Regardless of *how* you build your repository, you are required to document your codebase. Each project must have a `README.md` file that includes the following sections.

- Synopsis - a short description of what the codebase is for and how things are organized.
- Installation - a protocol for installing you code (including a list of dependencies).
- Usage - a description of how the user is meant to execute your code (including examples).
- Known Issues - an enumeration of any bugs and their workarounds.
- Authors - a list of the code authors and their contributions.
- References - a list of citations for codebases and papers used in your project.

**Deadline: Thursday, May 26 @ 11:59pm**

## Project Report

The culmination of your semester project with be a conference-style paper (maximum 8 pages, including references). You should format your papers according to the CVPR guidelines [here](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/sites/default/files/2021-08/ReviewTemplate.pdf). Until now you have viewed your work through the lens of your specific aims. Your report should examine the project as a whole. Try to find a narrative thread that ties together the different aspects of your project. Use this thread to help structure the sections of your paper.

### Report Details

Unlike the project proposal and presentation, you will not be required to have specific sections in your paper. That said, you may find it helpful to follow a typical paper format: introduction, related works, methods, results and discussion, conclusion, and references. You should feel free to organize your sections as you see fit, but keep in mind the goal of your report is to communicate your experience. I recommend that you use the following questions to guide your writing.

- What problems were being examined?
- What methods were used to address each problem?
- Why was each method chosen?
- What results were observed?
- What figures best summarize and communicate the results?
- What did the results indicate about the approach?
- Were the methods successful? If not, why?
- Are there improvements that should be made in the future?
- What would be the logical next step(s)?

As with any paper, your report will be evaluated on how well it communicates the aims, approach, results, and conclusions of your project. A PDF copy of your report must be committed to this repository.

**Deadline: Wednesday, June 1 @ 11:00am**
