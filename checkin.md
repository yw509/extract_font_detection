## Summary:
  1. According to the feedback of the proposal, we decided to change our final goal to recognizing the model and the license plate number of the car. The concept is: “transforming a physical object into a digital representation”. In this case, cars, which physically exist, would become digital. We think this is meaningful in today’s world, as reality is turning into simulation, and simulation is turning into reality. 
  2. We spent a great amount of time learning neural networks. At the same time, we also started to build the basic of neural network. However, we are still attempting to make the network work on our dataset now.
  3. Since we are dealing with car models recognition and license plate detection, a reliable dataset with high quality and quantity images is needed for machine learning and testing our algorithms.

      b. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection (For license plate detection)

## Plan:
  1. Currently, we are not pretty familiar with how to run neural networks, where we are planning to explore this more in future weeks.
  2. A computer system with higher computational power is needed to train our neural network.
